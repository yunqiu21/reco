Main idea:
We are planning to build a website called RECO that allows users to post things they want to
recommend to other users, such as products, restaurants, shops, food, etc. Users can also post
about things they do not recommend. Its main purpose is to allow users to exchange information
about the pros and cons of the products or other things, so that other people browsing the posts
have a better understanding of what to choose and what to avoid. Each user post contains a title,
zero or more pictures, and a description of the things they want to recommend. When users
want to search for a topic, they can also search by the keyword in the title, and all posts
containing the keyword will be displayed on the website.
