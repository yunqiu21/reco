<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
RECO allows users to post things they want to recommend to other users, such as food, movies, etc. 
Its main purpose is to allow users to exchange information about the pros and cons of the products 
or other things, so that other people browsing the posts have a better understanding of what to 
choose and what to avoid. Each user post contains a title, an optional picture, and a description 
of the things they want to recommend. When users want to search for a topic, they can also search 
by the keyword in the title, and all posts containing the keyword will be displayed on the page.
